# Centered Start button with position-split taskbar icons Mod for Windhawk

Pins the Windows/Start button to the exact horizontal center of the primary
monitor, regardless of how many taskbar icons are present. Running-app
taskbar buttons are split into two groups that flank the Start button:

- A button goes to the **left** group if its window's current on-screen
  position is left of screen-center.
- A button goes to the **right** group if its window is right of
  screen-center.
- Pinned-but-not-running apps have no window to check the position of, so
  they're classified by the `leftApps`/`rightApps` name lists below, falling
  back to `unresolvedAppsDefaultSide` if unlisted. Within whichever side
  they land on, `pinnedAppsAnchor` picks whether they sit at the far edge
  or right next to Start.

_The crosshair-marked window sits left of screen-center - its taskbar icon
follows, landing left of Start._

_The same window moved right of screen-center - its icon moves with it,
to the right of Start._

When you drag a window across the center line of the screen, its taskbar
button switches sides to follow it. Side-switching is driven by a global
window-location-change listener and is best-effort: it happens shortly
after a drag/move settles, not on every intermediate pixel of the drag.

Search, Task View and Widgets can either stay at the far left edge, or move
right next to Start on whichever side you prefer.

The window-tracking behind position-based splitting and drag-follow can be
turned off entirely with `trackWindowPositions`, if you'd rather keep just
the centered Start button and system-button placement with no background
probing of taskbar buttons and no system-wide event hooks - every app is
then classified the same way as a pinned-but-not-running one instead.

## Known limitations (please read before reporting issues)

- **Windows 11 only.** Windows 10's taskbar has no XAML layer to hook into.
- **Primary monitor only**, for both the Start button's position and
  window-side classification - and on a multi-monitor setup this is a
  bigger limitation than it might sound: a window's side is decided by
  comparing its position against the *primary* monitor's center line, so
  every window on a monitor entirely to one side of the primary reads as a
  fixed left/right regardless of where on that monitor it actually sits -
  only movement within the primary monitor (or across its center line) is
  tracked per-pixel. Taskbars on secondary displays aren't specially
  handled either (their icons keep Windows' default layout) - the mod's
  positioning plan is only ever computed on the primary taskbar's own
  thread, so secondary-monitor elements are simply never included in it
  and fall through to Windows' native positioning.
- **Don't enable alongside "Start button always on the left".** Both mods
  hook the same process-wide `IUIElement::Arrange` vtable slot, and both
  write their own X position for the Start button - with both enabled,
  they simply disagree, and whichever one's hook runs last for a given
  Arrange call wins for that pass. This mod's `systemButtonsPlacement:
  far-left` setting covers the same "keep everything else out of Start's
  way" goal that mod's `otherSystemButtonsOnTheLeft` option does, so
  there's no reason to run both together.
- **A very crowded side compresses instead of overflowing cleanly.** If
  enough app icons pile up on one side that they'd run into the system
  tray/clock on the right (or, in "far left" placement, into Search/Task
  View/Widgets on the left), icon spacing on that side is compressed just
  enough to keep the whole group within bounds - icons still render at
  full size, so once genuinely crowded they visually overlap each other
  rather than being hidden or scrolled the way the taskbar's own overflow
  handling would.
- **Windows' own "Combine taskbar buttons and hide labels: When taskbar
  is full" doesn't shrink icons under this mod** (icons stay full-size and
  compress/overlap instead, per the point above) - "Always" isn't
  affected and works normally. Likely because the "when full" decision is
  made by native layout logic (this mod only overrides each button's
  final X position afterward, it never touches sizing), evaluated against
  the taskbar's native, unsplit layout rather than this mod's split one -
  unconfirmed, not yet investigated further.
- **A grouped button (multiple windows combined under one icon) follows
  only its first window.** With "Combine taskbar buttons" set to "Always",
  a group's side and ordering are both decided by whichever of its windows
  happens to be first in the taskbar's own internal list - not necessarily
  the one you'd expect - so a group whose windows straddle the center line
  won't visually reflect all of them. There's no exposed way to pick a
  more meaningful "primary" window for a group, so this is a documented
  tradeoff rather than a bug.
- **The taskbar's own overflow button, when it appears on a crowded
  taskbar, keeps its native position** rather than being classified and
  placed like the buttons around it - this mod doesn't give it a slot in
  the split layout.
- **Undocumented internals.** This mod hooks private, unversioned classes
  inside `taskbar.dll` and `Taskbar.View.dll` (via symbols resolved from
  Microsoft's public symbol server at runtime, not hardcoded offsets). A
  Windows update can change these internals and break the mod until it's
  updated. If that happens, disable the mod rather than filing against
  explorer.exe crashing.
- The "resolve which HWND a taskbar button represents" step reuses a
  technique from other taskbar-reordering mods (synchronously reporting a
  sentinel "click" to the taskbar's internal click handler, which is
  intercepted before it does anything, to read back the window handle). It
  runs on a periodic timer rather than inline during layout, and Arrange
  only ever reads whatever the timer has already cached - running it
  synchronously from inside the taskbar's own layout pass was the
  confirmed cause of an explorer.exe crash (specifically when Windows'
  "show taskbar apps on" setting is anything other than "All taskbars",
  since that's when a window moving across monitors structurally adds/
  removes taskbar buttons rather than just repositioning them). As a
  further safeguard, the very first such probe of a session is held back
  until a real (non-sentinel) click has been seen passing through the same
  interception point - so a running app's icon may briefly show on its
  default side, rather than by window position, until you click any
  taskbar button once.
- **Taskbar buttons can disappear when a display is deactivated** (via
  Settings, unplugging, or a third-party display on/off tool) - if
  "Taskbar behaviors > When using multiple displays, show my taskbar apps
  on" isn't set to "All taskbars", Windows itself can drop a window's
  taskbar button entirely until you switch to that window (e.g. via
  Alt+Tab), rather than migrating it to the remaining taskbar. Reactivating
  a display doesn't trigger this. This is native Explorer/taskbar.dll
  behavior upstream of anything the mod hooks into, not something this mod
  causes or can work around.
